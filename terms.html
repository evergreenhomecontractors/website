  </p>

  <h3>Estimates, Proposals, and Pricing</h3>
  <p>
    All estimates, quotes, proposals, and pricing information provided by
    Evergreen Home Contractors are preliminary and non-binding unless expressly
    stated otherwise in a written agreement executed by both parties. Estimates
    are based on visual inspections, client-provided information, and conditions
    observable at the time of evaluation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Final pricing may vary due to changes in project scope, material availability,
    labor costs, site conditions, permitting requirements, inspections, code
    compliance issues, or unforeseen circumstances. Any changes or additions to
    the agreed scope of work must be approved in writing and may result in
    additional costs and adjusted timelines.

  </p>

  <h3>Scheduling, Delays, and Force Majeure</h3>
  <p>
    All project timelines and completion dates are estimates only and are subject
    to change. Evergreen Home Contractors shall not be liable for delays caused

    inspection delays, permitting issues, acts of government, labor disputes,
    natural disasters, or other events beyond the Company’s reasonable control.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the event of delays caused by force majeure or unforeseen circumstances,
    the Company shall be entitled to reasonable extensions of time without
    penalty or liability.

    specific services giving rise to the claim.
  </p>
